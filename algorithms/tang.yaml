  Automated seizure detection and classification from electroencephalography
  (EEG) can greatly improve seizure diagnosis and treatment. However, several
  modeling challenges remain unaddressed in prior automated seizure detection
  and classification studies: (1) representing non-Euclidean data structure in EEGs,
  (2) accurately classifying rare seizure types, and (3) lacking a quantitative inter-
  pretability approach to measure model ability to localize seizures. In this study,
  we address these challenges by (1) representing the spatiotemporal dependencies
  in EEGs using a graph neural network (GNN) and proposing two EEG graph
  structures that capture the electrode geometry or dynamic brain connectivity, (2)
  proposing a self-supervised pre-training method that predicts preprocessed sig-
  nals for the next time period to further improve model performance, particu-
  larly on rare seizure types, and (3) proposing a quantitative model interpretabil-
  ity approach to assess a model's ability to localize seizures within EEGs. When
  evaluating our approach on seizure detection and classification on a large pub-
  lic dataset (5,499 EEGs), we find that our GNN with self-supervised pre-training
  achieves 0.875 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve on seizure
  detection and 0.749 weighted F1-score on seizure classification, outperforming
  previous methods for both seizure detection and classification. Moreover, our
  self-supervised pre-training strategy significantly improves classification of rare
  seizure types (e.g. 47 points increase in combined tonic seizure accuracy over
  baselines). Furthermore, quantitative interpretability analysis shows that our GNN
  with self-supervised pre-training precisely localizes 25.4% focal seizures, a 21.9
  point improvement over existing CNNs. Finally, by superimposing the identified
  seizure locations on both raw EEG signals and EEG graphs, our approach could
  provide clinicians with an intuitive visualization of localized seizure regions.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
