  This is a deep learning-based approach for seizure detection, leveraging a
  pre-trained Labram model. Initial pre-training weights are sourced from the
  LaBraM repository, followed by fine-tuning on the TUEV dataset using
  cross-entropy loss across six classes. Further refinement incorporates TUEV,
  TUSZ, and Siena datasets, optimizing losses aligned with the sz_challenge2025
  target metric. Input EEG data consists of unipolar recordings from 19
  channels, preprocessed through notch filtering (50 Hz), resampling (200 Hz),
  and frame construction over five-second windows. Model inference is performed
  on four-hour EEG segments, producing boolean output masks, later converted
  into TSV format. Training data preprocessing includes file length filtering,
  label-based exclusion (Siena, TUSZ), and time-shift augmentation. Experimental
  results on the TUSZ dataset yield an F1 score of 0.43. The method operates
  with O(N) time complexity and requires sufficient memory allocation for
  loading EEG files. Benchmarks using an NVIDIA 3090 (12GB) and 62GB RAM
  indicate a total processing time of approximately two hours for the full TUSZ
  dataset.
