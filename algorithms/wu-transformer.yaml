abstract: >-
  We introduce a novel deep-learning architecture for simultaneous seizure
  detection that departs from traditional window-level classification methods.
  Instead of assigning a single label to segmented windows, our approach
  utilizes a deep encoder, comprising 1D convolutions, Network-in-Network
  modules, residual connections, and a transformer encoder with global
  attention, to process raw EEG signals in the time domain. This design produces
  high-level representations that capture rich temporal dependencies at each
  time step. A streamlined decoder then converts these features into a sequence
  of probabilities, directly indicating the presence or absence of seizures at
  every time step. By operating at the time-step level, our method avoids the
  need for complex post-processing to map window labels to events and eliminates
  redundant overlapping inferences, thereby enhancing the model’s efficiency and
  accuracy. Extensive experiments on a public EEG seizure detection dataset
  demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing approaches,
  underscoring its potential for real-time, precise seizure detection.
