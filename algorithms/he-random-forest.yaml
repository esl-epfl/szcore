  The EEG seizure detection algorithm is based on Random Forest Model. The model
  leverages a combination of statistical, spectral, and entropy-based features
  extracted from multi-channel EEG signals. Time-domain features include mean,
  variance, skewness, and kurtosis, while frequency-domain features are derived
  from Power Spectral Density (PSD) using Welch’s method. Additionally,
  entropy-based measures such as sample entropy and fuzzy entropy enhance the
  model’s ability to distinguish between seizure and non-seizure patterns. EEG
  signals are processed using a 2-second sliding window with 50% overlap, which
  are the same as the provided gotman1982 algorithm. The classification model
  consists of a Random Forest Classifier with 20 decision trees
  (n_estimators=20), utilizing class weighting (class_weight='balanced') to
  address class imbalance, and a fixed random seed (random_state=0). After
  applying the seizure detection model, the predictions might contain false
  positives, isolated short seizure detections, or closely spaced events, so
  nearby seizure events that occur within a short time gap are merged, and very
  short detections (e.g., less than 2 seconds) are removed to reduce false
  positives.
  The BIDS CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database were used for training and testing, using
  80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. So the sampling frequency is
  256 Hz, and number of channels is 18. Since the input data has 19 channel, one
  of the channel 'T3' will be deleted to ensure the features of the model are
  matched. Before feature extraction, the EEG signals undergo bandpass filtering
  (1–50 Hz), which is same as the provided gotman algorithm. 
  The performance evaluation is based on a binary classification problem, where
  Class 0 (Non-Seizure); Class 1 (Seizure). The overall accuracy is 99%, because
  this is largely influenced by the high number of non-seizure (Class 0)
  samples. Precision is 95% for seizures, F1 score is 0.8 on the test set. 
  The EEG seizure detection algorithm consists of feature extraction and
  classification. The algorithm processes EEG data using a 2-second sliding
  window with 50% overlap. Welch’s Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation is
  used to extract frequency-domain features, which has a complexity of O(N log
  N) for each window, where N is the number of EEG samples in the window. Other
  time-domain features (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, sample entropy,
  fuzzy entropy) are computed in O(N) time. Given W sliding windows, the total
  feature extraction complexity is O(W * N log N). The classification is
  performed using a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) with 20 estimators, so the
  classification complexity is (N trees × log features) per window.
