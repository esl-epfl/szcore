  Rationale and Algorithm: Seizure detection on scalp EEG faces challenges due
  to poor signal-to-noise ratio and heterogeneity in seizure patterns and
  localizations. We developed a feature extraction algorithm that captures
  seizure-related changes across various timescales and frequencies. Our
  approach combines linear, non-linear, and connectivity features, and uses
  these as input into a Gradient Boosted Trees model regularized by a 
  post-processing algorithm.

  Data Processing: EEGs were segmented into overlapping 10s windows (4s overlap)
  using all 19 standard EEG channels in average referential montage. We applied
  the Continuous Wavelet Transform with Morlet wavelets to decompose the signal
  into 8 frequency bands (from 3 Hz to 50 Hz, one 3–40 Hz band). After
  frequency-dependent downsampling, we extracted linear (band power), non-linear
  (fuzzy entropy and line length), and connectivity features (including
  betweenness, efficiency, eigenvector centrality, node strength) from the
  filtered signals. The scaled features were then processed through a machine
  learning pipeline combining minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance feature
  selection and XGBoost classification. The epoch-based predictions were
  regularized using the Firing Power algorithm, which consists in applying a
  moving average across tau segments and binarizing the results with a fixed
  threshold T.

  Training and Validation: The model was trained on a subset of the Temple
  University Hospital and the Siena Hospital Seizure Detection datasets. We
  conducted an initial feature exploration step through visual exploration of
  1,507 EEGs (training set) to narrow down the set of features and frequency
  bands. Hyperparameter selection was done with a random search over a nested
  cross-validation (100 iterations, 5-fold inner loop, 3-fold outer loop). The
  criterion for the cross-validation was the epoch-wise F1-score. The outer-loop
  predictions were used to select the optimal Firing Power’s tau and T values.

  Performance: We tested the best model on a held-out set of 453 EEGs from the
  same datasets, without overlap between subjects. With a  of 12 and T of 0.4,
  the model achieved an average event-based F1 score of 0.72 (precision = 0.34,
  sensitivity 0.30). For the final submissions, we further optimized tau and T
  on this held-out set.

  Complexity: Our optimized implementation employs frequency-domain convolutions
  and channel-wise parallelization, achieving logarithmic-linear complexity with
  signal length. Processing time averages 5 minutes per hour of EEG using 10 CPU
  cores and 50 GB RAM.
