abstract: >
  Prolonged EEG monitoring in epilepsy can be optimized by selectively
  recording ictal and interictal activity. We present a deep
  neural network-based method for automatic seizure detection, independent
  of clinical signs. The model analyzes EEG signals to identify paroxysmal
  rhythmic bursts (3–20 Hz) by evaluating amplitude, duration, and rhythmicity.
  Evaluated on 24 surface and 44 intracerebral recordings, the approach detects
  diverse seizure types. The system enables real-time, multi-channel seizure
  and spike detection."

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
