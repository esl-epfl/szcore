  Prolonged EEG monitoring in epilepsy can be optimized by selectively
  recording ictal and interictal activity. We present a deep
  neural network-based method for automatic seizure detection, independent
  of clinical signs. The model analyzes EEG signals to identify paroxysmal
  rhythmic bursts (3–20 Hz) by evaluating amplitude, duration, and rhythmicity.
  Evaluated on 24 surface and 44 intracerebral recordings, the approach detects
  diverse seizure types. The system enables real-time, multi-channel seizure
  and spike detection.
