  We submit the DynaSD seizure detection algorithm for the AI in Epilepsy
  seizure detection competition. This algorithm leverages multivariate
  autoregressive loss for unsupervised seizure detection. We first train a deep
  autoregressive model on the beginning of each continuous EEG clip to learn
  baseline neural dynamics. The model is then deployed on 1-second windows with
  0.5-second overlap, averaging the prediction error within each clip. Seizure
  detection is based on a threshold optimized on annotated intracranial EEG
  recordings. We tuned the following processing hyperparameters using a subset
  of the CHB-MIT dataset. Preprocessing includes bipolar re-referencing,
  normalizing the signal to the model training period, notch filtering at 60 and
  120 Hz, bandpass filtering from 1 to 100 Hz, and downsampling to 128 Hz. After
  thresholding, we apply a 15-second temporal smoothing procedure to reduce
  false positives from artifacts and epileptiform spikes. A window is classified
  as seizure activity only if at least 9 channels (more than half) are detected
  as seizing.
