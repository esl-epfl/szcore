  Introduction

  Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes recurring, unprovoked
  seizures. Recently, deep learning has offered a unique approach to reliable
  seizure detection by capturing latent patterns in EEG data in order to
  accurately predict seizure onset and duration. However, automatic seizure
  detection is still challenging due to high inter-subject variability, which
  limits model performance. We present DeepSOZ-HEM, a robust deep learning
  framework specifically designed for high-resolution seizure detection from
  multichannel scalp EEG, offering strong generalizability across multiple
  datasets.

  Methods

  Building upon our original DeepSOZ model (M. Shama, et al.), DeepSOZ-HEM
  leverages a transformer encoder to extract both global and channel-wise
  features from EEG, which are subsequently integrated via an LSTM module to
  capture temporal dynamics at a second-level resolution. The model is
  configured to accept inputs sampled at a frequency of 256 Hz and featuring 19
  channels from average-referenced data. We preprocessed data by splitting all
  recordings into 10-minute segments with 2 minutes of overlap between each
  segment of the recording, zero-padding when necessary. To postprocess the
  model’s predictions, we implemented a moving average (25-second) kernel that
  smoothed the outputs and stitched outputs from multiple segments of a
  recording before converting them into a BIDS-compatible format. We trained
  DeepSOZ-HEM using 10-fold cross-validation on a large cohort of 171 patients
  from the Temple University Hospital (TUH) corpus. To further enhance detection
  performance, we employed a hard example mining (HEM) strategy that iteratively
  retrains the model on selected EEG recordings containing heightened false
  positives and missed detections from the initial training phase on the TUH
  dataset. We chose to exclude CHB-MIT dataset as it is not average-referenced.
  Finally, the HEM process is complemented by additional training and validation
  on 14 patients from the University of Siena Scalp EEG Database for improved
  robustness and generalization.

  Results

  After the initial 10-fold training stage, we observed an average F1 score of
  0.62 土 0.11 across folds.  The best performing model split featured an F1
  score of 0.76. After retraining this model using the HEM strategy, we observed
  an event-based F1 score of 0.89 on the TUH validation set, indicating that the
  HEM strategy improved model performance. We also observed an event-based F1
  score of 0.72 on the Siena dataset, indicating high generalizability. The
  Siena dataset featured a slight drop in performance due to its large amount of
  long EEG recordings (12 hours or more) with almost exclusively background
  noise, leading to some inevitable false positives.

  Significance

  Based on the event-based metrics for F1 score, DeepSOZ-HEM indicates high
  potential for success in future clinical applications. This approach offers a
  reliable seizure detection algorithm that can be integrated into clinical
  workflows, especially due to its ability to generalize well to patient
  variability. Future works may consider retraining DeepSOZ’s onset zone
  localization branch and confidence scoring using HEM.
