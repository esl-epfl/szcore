abstract: >-
  Brain-Go-Brr is a seizure detection algorithm for long-term scalp EEG.
  It expects 19-channel 10-20 EEG at 256 Hz and produces HED-SCORE TSV event
  annotations. This submission uses Brain-Go-Brr's V3 architecture and the
  FLA (Gated DeltaNet) variant trained on TUH EEG Seizure Corpus.
