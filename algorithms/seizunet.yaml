abstract: >-
  Electroencephalography (EEG) is a vital tool for diagnosing and monitoring
  epilepsy. Manual annotation of epileptic seizures is a labor-intensive process
  performed by expert neurologists. Therefore, an automated seizure detection
  system can facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis. Recent
  advances in deep learning, along with the availability of large public EEG
  seizure datasets, have enabled the development of more effective seizure
  detection methods. In this work, we propose a seizure detection pipeline based
  on an attention U-Net, which processes EEG signals from two different views,
  one using raw EEG and the other filtered with a Wiener filter. Each U-Net
  generates multi-level predictions, capturing seizure patterns at different
  feature scales. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is then used to merge
  the outputs from both views for final seizure detection. The model is trained
  on the TUH EEG seizure dataset and the SeizIT2 dataset. While further
  refinements are needed for clinical application, the results demonstrate the
  potential of the proposed approach for robust automatic seizure detection.
