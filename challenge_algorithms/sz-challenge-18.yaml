  The algorithm analyzes data in 5 second segments. First the algorithm rejects bad 
  channels in each 5 second segment by looking for channels with high deflections in 
  amplitude or much higher power than other channels. Then the algorithm looks at theta 
  band power, ratio of temporal chain power on L versus R side, and delta power to 
  detect seizures. Then the algorithm looks at a variety of other spectral 
  characteristics like the ratio of theta and alpha power to increase specificity by 
  characterizing what non-seizure epochs look like. Lastly the algorithm looks for 
  sustained spectral relationships, as defined previously, over time to consider a 
  certain epoch to be seizure. The algorithm expects a sampling rate of 256 Hz, expects 
  channels to be referenced to the average of all electrodes (or some other common 
  reference), and  expects 19 channels. The data is filtered from 2-40 Hz and a notch 
  filter is applied at 50 Hz.  The algorithm is trained on the Siena dataset. 
  The algorithm achieved an average sensitivity of 58%, precision of 37 %, F1-score of 
  39%, and FP/24h of 29.1 on the Siena dataset. The algorithm is efficient, but can 
  benefit from training on a larger set of seizures.

            The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the Unit 
            of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena.  Subjects include 
            9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58). Subjects were monitored with 
            a Video-EEG with a sampling rate of 512 Hz, with electrodes arranged on the 
            basis of the international 10-20 System. Most of the recordings also contain 1 
            or 2 EKG signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures 
            according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy were 
            performed by an expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and 
            electrophysiological data of each patient.
