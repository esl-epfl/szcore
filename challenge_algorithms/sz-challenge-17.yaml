  This submission implements a self-supervised learning approach for EEG seizure 
  detection using a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). The model learns EEG 
  signal representations without requiring explicit seizure labels by predicting masked 
  portions of spectrograms from their surrounding context. This predictive task 
  encourages the model to learn meaningful features from the temporal and spatial 
  relationships within EEG data. The learned representations are then used with a 
  simple classifier for the downstream task of seizure detection. The approach leverages 
  large amounts of unlabeled EEG data to learn robust features that can generalize 
  across different patients and recording conditions.

  The model processes 6-channel EEG recordings sampled at 250 Hz, focusing on key 
  electrode positions (F3, C3, P3, F4, C4, P4). Input data undergoes preprocessing 
  including 60 Hz notch filtering, 0.5-124.9 Hz bandpass filtering, and normalization. 
  The spectrograms are computed using short-time Fourier transform with parameters 
  adjusted based on window length (20s w/ 50% overlap).

  Training utilized the TUH Seizure Corpus, containing thousands of EEG recordings 
  with annotated seizure events. Records with significant artifacts or unclear seizure 
  annotations were excluded. The self-supervised pretraining phase used all available 
  data, while the classifier training used a balanced subset of seizure and non-seizure 
  windows.

  On public evaluation data, the model achieved F1 scores above 0.82 for seizure 
  detection. The model requires approximately 3GB of GPU memory during inference (CUDA).

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
