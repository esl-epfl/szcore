  The detection of seizures in epileptic patients via Electroencephalography (EEG) is an 
  essential key to medical treatment. With the advances in deep learning, many 
  approaches are proposed to tackle this problem. However, concerns such as performance, 
  speed, and subject-independency should still be considered for practical application. 
  Thus, we propose EEGWaveNet, a novel end-to-end multiscale convolutional neural 
  network designed to address epileptic seizure detection. Our network utilizes 
  trainable depth-wise convolutions as discriminative filters to simultaneously gather 
  features from each EEG channel and separate the signal into multiscale resolution. 
  Then, the spatial-temporal features are extracted from each scale for further 
  classification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EEGWaveNet, we evaluate the model 
  in three datasets: CHB-MIT, TUSZ, and BONN. From the results, EEGWaveNet’s performance 
  is comparable to other baseline methods in the subject-dependent approach and 
  outperforms the others in subject-independent approaches. EEGWaveNet also has time 
  complexity comparable to the compact EEGNet-8,2. Moreover, we transfer the model 
  trained from the subject-independent approach and fine-tune it with a 1-h recording, 
  significantly improving sensitivity and F1-score (Binary) compared to without 
  fine-tuning. This article indicates the possibility of further developing this model 
  and the fine-tuning methodology toward healthcare 5.0, where the AI aid clinicians 
  in a manner of man–machine collaboration. This algorithm was trained on Physionet 
  CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset v1.0.0.

             This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, 
             consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with 
             intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several 
             days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to 
             characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for 
             surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases 
             and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 
             females, ages 1.5–19).
