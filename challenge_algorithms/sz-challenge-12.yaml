abstract: >
  Electroencephalography (EEG) is a vital tool for diagnosing and monitoring epilepsy. 
  Manual annotation of epileptic seizures is a labor-intensive process performed by 
  expert neurologists. Therefore, an automated seizure detection system can facilitate 
  faster and more cost-effective diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning, along with 
  the availability of large public EEG seizure datasets, have enabled the development of 
  more effective seizure detection methods. In this work, we propose a seizure detection 
  pipeline based on an attention U-Net, which processes EEG signals from two different 
  views, one using raw EEG and the other filtered with a Wiener filter. Each U-Net 
  generates multi-level predictions, capturing seizure patterns at different feature 
  scales. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is then used to merge the outputs from 
  both views for final seizure detection. The model is trained on the TUH EEG seizure 
  dataset and the SeizIT2 dataset. While further refinements are needed for clinical 
  application, the results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for robust 
  automatic seizure detection.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 â€“ 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
