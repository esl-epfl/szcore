abstract: > 
  This is a deep learning-based approach for seizure detection, leveraging a 
  pre-trained Labram model. Initial pre-training weights are sourced from the 
  LaBraM repository, followed by fine-tuning on the TUEV dataset using cross-entropy
  loss across six classes. Further refinement incorporates TUEV, TUSZ, and Siena 
  datasets, optimizing losses aligned with the sz_challenge2025 target metric. Input 
  EEG data consists of unipolar recordings from 19 channels, preprocessed through notch
  filtering (50 Hz), resampling (200 Hz), and frame construction over five-second 
  windows. Model inference is performed on four-hour EEG segments, producing boolean 
  output masks, later converted into TSV format. Training data preprocessing includes 
  file length filtering, label-based exclusion (Siena, TUSZ), and time-shift augmentation.
  Experimental results on the TUSZ dataset yield an F1 score of 0.43. The method operates
  with O(N) time complexity and requires sufficient memory allocation for loading EEG 
  files. Benchmarks using an NVIDIA 3090 (12GB) and 62GB RAM indicate a total processing
  time of approximately two hours for the full TUSZ dataset.

            The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the Unit 
            of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena.  Subjects include 
            9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58). Subjects were monitored with 
            a Video-EEG with a sampling rate of 512 Hz, with electrodes arranged on the 
            basis of the international 10-20 System. Most of the recordings also contain 1 
            or 2 EKG signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures 
            according to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy were 
            performed by an expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and 
            electrophysiological data of each patient.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
