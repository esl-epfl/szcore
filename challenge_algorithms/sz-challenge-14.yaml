  Clinical interpretations of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings remain an area of 
  uncertainty and high inter-reader variability - especially in resource-limited regions 
  of the world. While automation tools like artificial intelligence (AI) may aid diagnostic 
  support with remote and automated interpretation, annotated EEG data is scarce and the 
  lack of publicly available labelled EEG data makes it difficult to build robust automation 
  tools. With the recent surge in popularity in using self-supervised learning and 
  transformer models, e.g. GPT-4 and similar large language models (LLMs), we have seen 
  that unlabeled data can be used to learn inherent structures and contextual information. 
  In this work, a general-purpose EEG transformer model pre-trained on massive, unlabeled, 
  and publicly available EEG data is proposed. Using smaller and labeled datasets, the 
  general-purpose model is later adjusted to specific downstream tasks like seizure 
  detection. We thus present a pipeline with the capacity to train and improve model 
  prediction, with the ability to generalize to the larger realm of neurological findings 
  using EEG.

  For the proposed STORM architecture, pretraining and downstream finetuning can be divided 
  into two separate systems in which self-supervised learning (SSL) is incorporated in the 
  pretraining structure.

  Here, a PyTorch implementation of the BErt-like Neurophysiological Data Representation 
  (BENDR) model by Kostas et al. was used in a Deep Neural Network (DNN) setting. This
  setting utilizes a transformer-based architecture, which is applied for the pretraining 
  of a Latent Feature Encoder (LFE), where the BENDR model is trained using contrastive 
  learning with masked signal reconstruction. Following this, the LFE was used in the 
  downstream finetuning structure where a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is tuned for 
  prediction using preprocessed and labeled EEG data. The predictive model was trained 
  using 10-fold cross-validation for optimization of hyperparameters, and evaluated on a 
  hold-out set. As the model is pre-trained, downstream fine-tuning requires significantly 
  less data to achieve the presented results, demonstrating the efficiency and 
  computational effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Following the training and 
  fine-tuning of the proposed pipeline, a series of post-processing steps were optimized 
  using a separate evaluation set and a Bayesian Optimization approach. Here, majority 
  voting, minimum epilepsy duration and merge of occurrences were implemented with each 
  method possessing a singular hyperparameter. Moreover, varying window lengths of the 
  model, for the prediction of seizures, were implemented and used combinatorially as a 
  final voting system in the inference of the pipeline. 

  For pre-training the transformer model, the Temple University Hospital EEG Corpus (TUEG) 
  was utilized as the primary motivator of the self-supervised deep learning pipeline for 
  EEG data. It comprises 26,846 clinical EEG recordings collected at Temple University 
  Hospital (TUH) in Philadelphia from 2002 to 2017, split into 69,652 EDF files. It takes 
  1.6 TB of storage, and is entirely unlabeled. 

  The recordings were obtained from a diverse patient population with a variety of 
  neurological conditions, including epilepsy, sleep disorders, and other brain-related 
  health problems. The EEG recordings include different EEG tests, allowing investigation 
  of various neurological phenomena. However, the variety in experiment setups also means 
  that the data format is not unified. 

  The multilayer-perceptron model was finetuned using the learning encodings of the 
  transformer model on the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus. The corpus includes 675 patients with 
  1643 sessions spread over 7361 files, and all data was, during tuning, balanced with 
  majority downsampling.

  For the proposed architecture, the preprocessing methodology builds on the scalable and 
  efficient framework introduced in the SPEED pipeline by Madsen et al., optimizing it 
  further for robust and large-scale self-supervised learning of EEG data. This methodology 
  enables the use of unlabeled data for large model training, in which multiple
  preprocessing steps are carried out to ensure optimal data quality for the prediction 
  task at hand.

  The pipeline is initialized by standardizing channel names, setting the montage and 
  segmenting the data into 60-second windows. 

  Bad channels are then detected, and windows with insufficient quality are 
  removed - assessment is based on the signal-to-noise ratio or if the signal exhibits high
  variance. Following this, a region-based power line notch filter, a high-pass filter 
  (1 Hz) and a low-pass (70 Hz) filter are applied. Moreover, a notch filter is applied to 
  assist in the removal of power line noise. Robust detrending is applied to eliminate 
  linear trends, followed by average referencing to standardize the signal across channels.  
  Lastly, missing channels are interpolated using Legendre polynomial expansion via the 
  minimum-norm method, after which all signals are resampled at 256 Hz for uniformity. 
  The pipeline utilizes the 19 most common electrode channels from the TUEG in the 
  following order:

  {F p 1, F p 2, F 7, F 3, F z, F 4, F 8, T 7, C 3, C z, C 4, T 8, P 7, P 3, P z, P 4, 
  P 8, O 1, O 2}

  The final performance was measured using a previously unseen portion of the input data. 
  To clarify, fine-tuning of the multilayer-perceptron, optimization of the post-processing 
  and final evaluation of the model performance were all realized using varying and 
  non-overlapping subsets of the TUH EEG Seizure dataset. On the final set, the model 
  held an event-based f1-score of 0.7593, which was calculated using the esl-epfl 
  timescoring github repo. 
  
  These results show a clear indication of significant performance in the realm of 
  epileptic seizure detection with a non-balanced and unseen testing set. Improvement 
  in performance could naturally occur by training on more diverse datasets, such as 
  including Siena Scalp EEG and CHB-MIT. This will be pursued in a later implementation 
  devoid of time-constraints and with larger availability in computational power. 
  Moreover, for a better gauge of the predictive capabilities, multiple runs with varying 
  random seeds for the splits of the data would be advantageous. Such an approach would 
  provide a confidence interval which offers a more robust fundament for comparative 
  measures.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
