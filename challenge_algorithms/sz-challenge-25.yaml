  S4Seizure: A structured-state space models for seizure detection

  We present S4Seizure, a simple seizure detection model based on a standard S4 
  backbone, segmenting 12-second EEG windows into seizure and nonseizure states 
  at a 1 Hz resolution. The model processes all 19 EEG channels with minimal 
  preprocessing, including bandpass filtering (0.5–120 Hz) and notch filtering 
  (50 Hz and 60 Hz). The EEG window is then transformed with a short-term 
  Fourier-transform using 1-second non-overlapping segments. We standardized 
  input data per channel across the entire training set. During inference, 
  predictions are made in 1-second increments across a recording, with the 
  final classification obtained by averaging predictions over time. We trained 
  S4Seizure on the Temple University Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) and evaluated it on 
  the Siena Seizure Dataset (SSDD) and the TUSZ evaluation set. It achieved a 
  subject-averaged F1 score of 0.62 on SSDD and 0.70 on the TUSZ evaluation dataset, 
  demonstrating strong generalization to unseen data.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
