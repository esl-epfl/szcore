  We present HySEIZa, a seizure detection model leveraging the Hyena hierarchy for 
  efficient long-range EEG processing. The model classifies 12-second EEG windows 
  into seizure and non-seizure states at 1 Hz resolution, processing all 19 EEG 
  channels with minimal preprocessing, including bandpass filtering (0.5–120 Hz) 
  and notch filtering (50 Hz and 60 Hz). EEG signals are transformed using a 
  short-term Fourier transform (STFT) with 1-second non-overlapping segments. 
  Input features are standardized per channel across the training set. During 
  inference, the model performs sliding-window predictions at 1-second increments, 
  and the final classification is obtained by averaging predictions over time. We 
  train and evaluate HySEIZa on the Temple University Seizure Corpus (TUSZ). In 
  this version of the model has 6 hyena blocks, and, the decision threshold was 
  set to 0.58. Using this setting, it  achieved a subject-averaged F1 score of 
  64.01 on the TUSZ evaluation dataset.

            This database is a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that was collected 
            from archival records of clinical EEG at Temple University Hospital 
            recorded between 2002 – 2017. From this large dataset, a subset of 
            files with a high likelihood of containing seizures was retained 
            based on clinical notes and on the output of seizure detection 
            algorithms.
            V2.0.0 contains 7377 .edf files from 675 subjects for a total 
            duration of 1476 hours of data. The files are mostly short 
            (avg. 10 minutes). The dataset has heterogeneous sampling frequency 
            and number of channels. All files are acquired at a minimum of 250 
            Hz. A minimum of 17 EEG channels is available in all recordings. 
            They are positioned according to the 10-20 system.
            The annotations are provided as .csv and contain the start time, 
            stop, channel and seizure type.
